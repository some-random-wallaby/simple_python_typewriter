# Typewriter

Simple typewriter-like webpage, written in HTML, Python & CSS. 

Just a programming excercise, but maybe useful for writers who are obsessive editors. 

It has dark & light modes, and a couple of sfx (credits below). 

To run it:
 - download the files
 - make sure you have python installed
 - open the terminal (or cmd)
 - cd (change directory) into to that folder
 - run the command: python -m http.server 8000
 - open your browser to the url: http://localhost:8000/typewriter.html
